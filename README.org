This is just a description which eventually is going to make sense.

** [[./sections/bundled#bundled-features][Bundled features]]
These features come bundled with Emacs, so they have to be configured first.
#+INCLUDE: ./sections/bundled/README.org

# #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
#   ;; Add the sections bundled directory to the path list and load its index.
#   (etor/path:put "sections-bundled" "sections:bundled")
#   (org-babel-load-file (concat (etor/path:get "sections-bundled") etor/init:index))
#   (message "Hola fucking mundo!)
# #+END_SRC

# (etor/path:put "sections-packages" "sections:packages")
# (etor/path:put "sections-custom" "sections:custom")

# ** [[./sections/content#content-features][Content features]]
# These add functionality to the content, depending on its type.
# #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
#   (org-babel-load-file (concat etor/path:content etor/init:index))
# #+END_SRC

# ** [[./sections/system#system-integration][System integration]]
# These are some external features available on the system that will be integrated to Emacs.
# #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
#   (org-babel-load-file (concat etor/path:system etor/init:index))
# #+END_SRC

# ** [[./custom#customization][Customization]]
# Variables, functions and commands that should not be included if you're not me.
# #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
#   (org-babel-load-file (concat etor/path:custom etor/init:index))
# #+END_SRC
