* My emacs configuration.
This is just a description which eventually is going to make sense.

** [[./sections/editor#editor-features][Editor features]]
These features add new capabilities to Emacs, they don't depend on specific syntax/modes.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-load-file (concat etor/path:editor etor/init:index))
#+END_SRC

** [[./sections/content#content-features][Content features]]
These add functionality to the content, depending on its type.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-load-file (concat etor/path:content etor/init:index))
#+END_SRC

** [[./sections/system#system-integration][System integration]]
These are some external features available on the system that will be integrated to Emacs.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-load-file (concat etor/path:system etor/init:index))
#+END_SRC

** [[./custom#customization][Customization]]
Variables, functions and commands that should not be included if you're not me.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-load-file (concat etor/path:custom etor/init:index))
#+END_SRC
