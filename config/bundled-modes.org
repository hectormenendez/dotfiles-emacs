#+TITLE: Bundled modes

*** Help buffers
These are the buffers that appear when browsing the Emacs help.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package help
      :commands help-mode
      :config
          (setq help-window-select t); whenever the help buffer appears, select it.
  )
#+END_SRC

*** Server
Allows you to run the instance of Emacs as a server, so EmacsClient can connect without
having to reload the init file. *Right now I have it disabled.*
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package server
      :demand t
      :disabled
      :init
          (add-hook 'after-init-hook (lambda ()
              (unless (server-running-p) (server-start))
          ))
  )
#+END_SRC
