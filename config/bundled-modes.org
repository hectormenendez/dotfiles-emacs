#+TITLE: Bundled modes

*** Help buffers
These are the buffers that appear when browsing the Emacs help.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package help
      :commands help-mode
      :config
          (setq help-window-select t); whenever the help buffer appears, select it.
  )
#+END_SRC

*** Server
Allows you to run the instance of Emacs as a server, so EmacsClient can connect without
having to reload the init file. *Right now I have it disabled.*
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package server
      :disabled
      :init
          (add-hook 'after-init-hook (lambda ()
              (unless (server-running-p) (server-start))
          ))
  )
#+END_SRC

*** Programming Mode
Editor major mode which englobes all programming languages.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package prog-mode
      :commands prog-mode
      :config
          (setq
              ; Tell Emacs to replace certain character combinations with special ligatures
              prettify-symbols-alist (append prettify-symbols-alist etor/ligature-alist)
          )
          (global-prettify-symbols-mode 1)
  )
#+END_SRC

*** ORG Mode
A major mode which allows you to keep notes, maintain TODO list, plan projects and
authoring documents (like this one).
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package org
      :ensure org-plus-contrib; Use the latest version from repository instead of bundled
      :pin org
      :commands org-mode
      :config
          (setq
              org-hide-leading-stars t; Don't show the stars on headings.
              org-return-follows-link t; When RET is pressed over a link, it opens it.
              org-startup-folded t; make headings fold on startup
              org-startup-indented t; Automatically indent according to headings.
          )
  )
